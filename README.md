# Parksy

**Parksy** is a portfolio project designed to showcase UI development skills. Built over a 2–3 day stretch, it focuses on creating a pleasant and simple interface for exploring national parks and hikes using the NPS API.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Parksy was created as a lightweight, fun project meant to highlight front-end UI styling, interaction with public APIs, and the ability to develop a clean, responsive layout in a short time frame. It’s not intended for commercial use or production deployment.

## ✅ What Works Well

- **Park and hike display**: The interface clearly presents parks and hiking opportunities.
- **Thematic UI styling**: The design reflects the outdoor/adventure theme nicely.
- **Functionality**: For a lightweight API/UI demo, the core features perform well and without issue.

## 🧪 What Could Be Improved

- **Loading time**: Performance could be optimized. It's currently unclear whether the lag is due to the NPS API or local implementation.
- **Authentication**: Sign-in/sign-out functionality has not yet been finalized. It may be added in the future, but is not currently necessary for this portfolio piece.
- **Data quality**: The API data itself is not particularly well-formatted or visually appealing.
  - This is intentional — as a newcomer to the national park scene, I chose to leave the rawness intact.
  - Given the likely constraints of the NPS team (or possibly an intern who built the API — just a hunch!), I didn’t expect pristine data structure or presentation.

## 📌 Notes

This project is a passion-driven demo rather than a polished product. It’s meant to reflect creativity, speed, and a sense of humor — not perfection or completeness.

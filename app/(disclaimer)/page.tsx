                I'm writing this disclaimer for the .001% chance that someone from the National Park Service sees this.
                I'm a software engineer with a passion for the national parks, and need for a few portfolio projects.
                I am <i>extremely</i> skeptical this will ever grow to more than 10-15 users. And any national parks 
                images, branding, etc, is used for education purposes only. If this is at the point where you feel 
                there is a need to remove it. Please contact me at dwelsh2@clemson.edu, and I will remove it immediately
                and preferrably quietly.
            </p>
